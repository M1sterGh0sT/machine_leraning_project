Algorithms
  1. Random Forest
  - Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn is used.
  - The model is trained on the training data.
  - Predictions are made on the test data.
  - Classification report is generated to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Gradient Boosting
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier from scikit-learn is used.
  - The model is trained on the training data.
  - Predictions are made on the test data.
  - Classification report is generated to evaluate the model's performance.

3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - A basic CNN architecture is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - The model is trained on the training data.
  - Predictions are made on the test data.
  - The model's training progress is displayed.
